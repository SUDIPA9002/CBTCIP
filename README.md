## CBTCIP: CipherByte Technologies Internship
### Task -1 : IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Iris flower has three species- 1. setosa 2. versicolor 3. virginica, which differs according to their measurements. 

Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

I completed the task successfully and made a website to predict the class using machine learning model.

### Task -2 : UNEMPLOYEMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. 
We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.
